icap_server
==============

This is a ICAP server writen in python with pyicap framework.

The ideia is to do a plugin based ICAP server easy to extend and learn.

This is a very early project, not even alpha,

I'm not a very talented programmer, so, I need help to go alpha!

TODO:
 - Implement ICAP preview
 - Change the log system (rewrite the pyicap log)
 - many others... :)
